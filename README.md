# Textify-Audio-Image-to-Text-Converter

Textify is a multimodal project that converts audio and images into text.
It combines speech-to-text and optical character recognition (OCR) to help users quickly transcribe spoken content and extract text from images.

This project can be useful for:

Taking quick notes from audio recordings.

Converting scanned documents or images into editable text.

Accessibility purposes (helping people with hearing or vision difficulties).

Automating transcription and text extraction tasks.
